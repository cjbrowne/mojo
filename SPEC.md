## World Server
- Anti-cheat
	- Speed limits: if a player moves further than a certain threshold in a certain time period, consider it a speedhack.
	- Combat limits: impose cooldown periods on all spells and abilities.  If a player attempts to cast a spell during a cooldown period, silently ignore the cast.
	- API limits: if a 'bad' API request (e.g. attempt to list characters of another playerId) occurs, register it as a potential hack attempt by the originating account.
	- Anti-botting: attempt to automatically detect bot scripts and punish the account responsible.
- Client-facing API
	- List Characters
	- Get Character information (for "inspection" and "dressing room" UI elements)
	- Move (ideally via absolute position updates rather than relative, so that lag isn't noticeable for your own character)
	- Cast Spell
	- Attack (with weapon)
	- Enter game world (spawn) {send back: player position, current map tile, nearby NPC list, nearby player list}
- Determine clients in close proximity to one another, update close-proximity clients when necessary.
